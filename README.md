# Designing the best font ever

## The goal

My goal with this font is to create a font like Avenir, DM Sans, Silurum, Merel, but with the following priorities:

1. To be used in (mostly large) headings, and all-caps word mark
2. Fairly high x-height
3. Circle shapes for round letters such as O, Q, C, a, b, etc.
4. Cross point for capital letters fairly low (e.g. A, R, Y)
5. Generally wide letters (wider than DM Sans; Silurum is okay)

Well, at least it can be used to display text...

### Progress

![Preview for 2025-12-19](2025-12-19/sample.png)

Installed FontForge (on macOS), and literally only created 26 glyphs to cover the letters A-Z, and copy pasted those to the lower case letters a-z. I created the glyphs not thinking at all, just making them look a bit like a sans-serif font, using the path tools only.
